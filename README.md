# Binary Tree

There are examples in different languages of binary tree implementation.

[C](./examples/binary-tree.c)
| [C++](./examples/binary-tree.cpp)
| [Python](./examples/Python/binary-tree.py)
| [JavaScript](./examples/JavaScript/binary-tree.js)

---

Each implementation contains next functions or methods depends on language paradigm:

- **Depth first values** - explore the nodes of the tree, starting from a root node, and it returns a list of node values in the order they were visited
- **Breath first Values** - visiting all root immediate children before moving on to their children, and so on.
- **Tree Includes** - checks whether a given value exists within a binary tree.
- **Tree Sum** - The "Tree Sum" function calculates the sum of all the values stored in the nodes of a binary tree.
- **Tree Min Value** - finds the minimum value.
- **Max Root to Leaf Path Sum** - calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by following a path from the root node to any leaf node in a binary tree.

### Examples

Each example has *run.sh* file which can be run by `sh run.sh` command. Files structure and names are the same for every language, difference in implementation only.
